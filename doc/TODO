* Bugs
** Fix api constructorconstructor syntax highlighting
** try running client only test on server
 eg; rich-text-editor-test on server - stack trace is unhelpful (hint: remove isClient)

** Lock doc by id before update
   Do in query-server.js. lock waits if already locked.

** SRP is CPU intensive and blocks node;
   is this true for server logic?
   consider handing off to worker thread on server

-------

* Feature Ideas
** Put test hooks in WeakMap on module

   Test is only

** Server update multiple records
   could do one fetch then one update then proceed similar to client.

** Server side publish should batch sends to client
   Redundant; see [[Batch client messages until end of transaction]]

   When mutilple subscriptions are interested in the same doc we should
   only send once to client. We can have a feature in the notify that
   allows the pub to register a callback if it wants to send data to
   client. The callback is run once all observers are notified.

   We want to register it via the sessId so that only one callback is
   registered per session.

   More thoughts:

   notify should pass an extra arg: an Inform func which if called is
   passed a callback to call after everyone notified.

   This is used by the publish logic to actually send data to the
   client. if two observers match the same doc then only one message
   needs to be sent to client. Also fields can be filtered here.

   The publish should only call the Inform func if not already called.

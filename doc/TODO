* setUserId needs to fixup any open subscriptions
 Tricky when sub sets the userId

* Need to fix reconnect sending messages and subscriptions

* Server update multiple records
   could do one fetch then one update then proceed similar to client.


* SRP is CPU intensive and blocks node;
   consider handing off to worker thread on server

* Use https://github.com/ahyatt/emacs-websocket
   to talk to server instead of geddon-test.js
